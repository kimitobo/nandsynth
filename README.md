# Nandsynth
Nandsynth is an educational DIY kit for solar-powered electronic sound experiments. The participants learn the basics of electronic sound synthesis and using solar energy instead of batteries. The participants are also introduced to electronic prototyping with a breadboard and components to the level of continuing the experiments after the workshop.
